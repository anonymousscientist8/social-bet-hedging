## Social uncertainty influences the optimal balance of quantity and quality of cooperative relationships

# Decscription
This project looked to model the behavior of the common vampire bat, looking to realistically simulate roost switching, foraging, allogrooming, food sharing, reproduction, birth, and death. By doing so, we hoped to investigate how manipulating social uncertainty via average roost switching rate influenced the evolution of more diversifying (i.e., investment into quantity of relationships) or focusing (i.e., investment into quality of relationships) allogrooming strategies. Included here are NetLogo behaviorspace output files showing the number of bats using each of six genetically-determined allogrooming strategies, as well as R code used to process this data and create figures.
